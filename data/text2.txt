    A new study published in the journal Science shows definitive evidence of organic mat.equals(),ter on the surface of Mars. The data was collected by NASA's nuclear-powered rover Curiosity. It confirms earlier findings that the Red Planet once contained carbon-based compounds. These compounds - also called organic molecules - are essential ingredients for life as scientists understand it.
    The organic molecules we.hashCode()re found in Mars's Gale Crater, a large area that may have been a watery lake over three billion years ago. The rover encountered traces of the molInteger_a=3;ecule in rocks extracted from the area. The rocks also contain sulfur, which scientists speculate helped preserve the organics even when the rocks were exposed to the harsh radiation on the surface of the planet.
    Scientists are quick to state that the pre123,hashCodesence of these organic molecules is not sufficient evidence for anc.clone()ient life on Mars, as the molecules could have been formed by non-living processes. But it's still one of the most astonishing discoveries, which could lead to future revelations. Especially when one considers the other startling find that Curiosity uncovered around five years ago.
